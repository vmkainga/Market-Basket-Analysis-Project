Market Basket Analysis Project

Care five is a German multinational retail corporation headquartered in Berlin, Germany.
It is the eighth-largest retailer in the world by revenue. It operates a chain of
hypermarkets, groceries stores, and convenience stores, which as of January 2021,
comprises its 12,00 stores in over 30 countries.

As a Data analyst working for one of the stores, you must perform market basket
analysis to help the store maximize revenue. More specifically, your task will analyze
transactional data to identify the top 10 products likely to be purchased together.
Given a dataset containing transactional data of products sold in the past week, you will
be required to perform the following:

● Define the business question

● Perform data importation and loading

● Perform data preprocessing

● Find frequent itemsets

● Generate association rules

● Perform metric interpretation and provide recommendation
